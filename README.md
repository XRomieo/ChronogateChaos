# ChronogateChaos

**Concept of the game:** In this game 2 portals, called Chronogates, have been opened by the main character's former partner. The chronogates can allow one-way travel through time, meaning that anyone could come out from them but one cannot travel from the current era to another era. One of the chronegate is from the past and the other one is from the future. Our main character is on a mission to close these portals, but in his paths stand various enemies and the Final Boss ZORO. After beating Zoro our mission would be completed.

**Gameplay mechanics:** The player can move forward, backwards, jump and slide. The Player would face various enemies on his way, who have come out of the Chronogates. There are different strength levels for the enemies. The main objective is to beat all the enemies and close the chronogates, one simply cannot advance by just dodging the enemies, he must defeat them.

**Controls:** W to jump, A for backward movement, S for forward movement, Space for slide. The aim would be done via the mouse cursor. The player would aim/shoot wherever the pointer's position is.
